# UAB IT Website CSS
This CSS library is used on web pages owned by the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Department of Information Technology. 

This CSS project is accompanied with a new and developing web communications strategy for IT as well as a rebuild of the core IT website, so not everything here always makes sense. This project runs on UAB Joomla sites also running the Linear template, it has not been tested with legacy templates and is incompatible with Wordpress sites.

This CSS library is maintained by UABIT's Communications team and builds on the CSS written by central University Relations and Web Communications. It takes direction from the [UAB brand toolkit](https://www.uab.edu/toolkit/) and other UAB websites to reinforce the UAB brand and the personality of IT.

## Deployment

Currently, this library is a work-in-progress and is not used on any production sites, but is planned to be implemented in early 2020.

As of writing, this CSS library is planned to be used on
