      <p>With UAB IT’s TechTools program, you can get a bundled computer package — either a replacement or for a new employee — in less than a day. UAB IT maintains a stock of Dell computers and accessories that help streamline the ordering process, so that instead of three weeks, you wait 24 hours for your new computer. The program will expand in 2020 to all Desktop Services customers.</p>

The Research Computing OnDemand portal helps streamline the experience so researchers interested in harnessing the power of Cheaha can get right to work. “We’ve removed a lot of potential apprehension and learning overhead in approaching the cluster,” said John-Paul Robinson, architect for UAB’s high-performance computing cluster.</p>
