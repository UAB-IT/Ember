      <p>UAB is powered by will — but sometimes innovation benefits from a boost from technology. Research and work across campus inspire UAB IT to bring you solutions that fuel innovation — so that you can change the world with studies that can help cure Parkinson’s disease; funding for schizophrenia research; a tool that helps partner students and medical professionals to improve patient care.</p>

      <p>Sometimes the simplest solutions can streamline your day — so you can get more important work done. Documents signed from any device, no matter where you are. A mobile app that allows you to take your desk phone with you. A collaboration solution so you can chat with co-workers on the go. Customer service that replaces your desktop in under two hours.</p>
      <h3>Sign anywhere, anytime</h3>
      <p>Financial forms for the School of Medicine can be complicated, with grant and account approvals needing several signatures before they are complete. But when those forms were created in the electronic signature tool DocuSign, turnaround time was cut in half. Now financial officers like Staci Johnson can track the forms, have signers complete their approvals electronically even when they are out of the office or out of the country, and keep complete records once all signatures are obtained.</p>

Assistant Vice President and Chief of Police Anthony Purcell’s department was among the first to receive new phones powered by a voice-over-internet system that will eventually replace all of the phones on campus. “I love the new phones, and they are really simple to use,” Purcell says.</p>
