# Menus

There are three types of menus on the IT website: top navigation, sidebars, and quicklinks. There is only one top navigation menu, it holds links to each section on the website and is displayed at the top of every web page as a horizontal navigation bar. There is also only one quicklink menu, it holds important links for internal and external users and is located at the top right of every page, under the search bar. There is a sidebar menu for each section and they hold all pages and subpages that fall into that section, as well as ant relevent external links.
