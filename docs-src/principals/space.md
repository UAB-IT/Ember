# Space

Intentional use of empty space give the reader room to breathe and offer a space for the brain to process information. Empty space helps organize and seperate content and creates meaningful associations, connections, or divisions. Consistant use of empty space is called **vertical rhythem** and helps guide the reader through the page's content.

The IT websites use a standard set of measurements to create space throughout the website. These measurements are based on tyopgraphic principals and are intertwined with the website's typography.

Each unit of measurement must be a multiple of the line height of the website's body copy. These measurements will be shown below in a unit relative to the website's font size and a calculated pixel value based on the assumption that the font size of the body is 16px, as it should be under normal circumstances.

The pixel representation should ONLY be used in design mocks, never in production code. For use on the website, the relative unit must be used.

| Pixel Representation | Relative Unit |
|----------------------|---------------|
|         0px          |      0rem     |
|        25.6px        |     1.6rem    |
|        51.2px        |     3.2rem    |
|        76.8px        |     4.8rem    |
|       102.4px        |     6.4rem    |
|        128px         |     8.0rem    |
|       153.6px        |     6.9rem    |
|       179.2px        |     11.2rem   |
