# Inclusive Design

The most important pillar of the IT website is a foundation of inclusive design. Design and content mean nothing if it excludes any part of the audience. Inclusive design is an array of design tactics from wording changes to technical accuracy. More than any specific action, inclusive design is a mindset.

## Basic HTML

There are a lot of things we can do while developing webpages to make sure the content is accessibile to all audiences. While a working knowledge of HTML is not strictly required to publish a webpage on the site, it is strongly encouraged. HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. Proper HTML structure can help assistive technology differentiate a header from a paragraph. Please take time to look over this [basic HTML introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) from the Mozilla Developer Network. This website is home to a wealth of technical documentation that will hopefully become referenced as much as the docs you are reading now.

After you have an idea of what HTML is, how its used, and why it is so important, read up on these HTML elements - you'll use them a lot when making new webpages:

* `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>` headding elements
* `<p>` paragraph element
* `<ol>, <ul>, <li>` ordered lists, unordered lists, and list items
* `<dl>, <dt>, <dd>` definition list, definition term, and definition description
* `<table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, <td>` table, table header, table body, table row, table headding, and table data
* `<a>` the anchor element, used to create links
* `<img>` the image element
* `<figure>, <figcaption>` figure and figure caption
* `<strong>` strong
* `<blockquote>` The blockquote element, used to create pullquotes
* `<div>` division

These elements form the backbone of every website on the internet and is core to the experience of every student, faculty member, employee, researcher, and parent that comes to our website.

## Accessibility

To understand more about web acceessibility, please review the [UAB Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.uab.edu/toolkit/web/accessibility), the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://www.ada.gov/), and the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) set forth by the W3C and globally accepted as best practices.

## Adjusting language

Beyond perfectly structured code, we can make content more inclusive by being more mindful about how we say things. First and formost, be sure to adhere to the [University's writing style](https://www.uab.edu/toolkit/brand-basics/voice/style-guide) as outlined by University Relations. Also be careful not to assumptions based on the audience's race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
