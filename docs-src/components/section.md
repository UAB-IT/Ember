# Section

Sections group chunks of content together by adding a "section space" above and below the group using top and bottom margins.

Create a section by wrapping its contents in a division element with the `section` class.

```html
<div class="section">
CONTENT HERE
</div>
```

On pages without sidebars, sections can also have a grey background that extends from one edge of the screen to another.

```html
<div class="section has-background-full">
CONTENT HERE
</div>
```
