This CSS/JS library is maintained by UABIT's Communications team and builds on the CSS written by the central University Relations and Web Communications team. It takes direction from the [UAB brand toolkit](https://www.uab.edu/toolkit/) and other UAB websites to reinforce the UAB brand and the personality of Information Technology at UAB.
